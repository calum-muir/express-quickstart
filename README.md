Project to get quickly up and running with a barebones express server. 

To get started pull the repo and install
```
npm i
```

You will need to create a .env file to define the port (variable used is PORT) to run the server on. It is advisable to store any credentials you need here as well.

```
touch .env
```

When running in development mode the express server will automatically restart upon saved changes.
```
npm run dev
```
